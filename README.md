Playing around with PGA Tour Statistics
plot.ly isn't working at end of project. Will sort out if I come back to this. In addition, this is not up to date beyond 8/1/2020. This is more just a simple visual analysis to see some of the aspects
of how the pull of statistics from the PGA tour website would go and how they organize their information.
